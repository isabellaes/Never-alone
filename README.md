# Never-alone 
School project for examination

Never Alone is an app for people with mental illness, or people who just want to write down
daily notes, track their moods or do some meditations. The idea for this app came from our own
history with mental illness and the fact that this is a problem so many people struggle with. Me
and my classmate Eva-Li worked with this app for a couple of months and we started out with a
simple plan that came to grow during time. Our App contains several methods for taking care of
your mental health and getting access to help from psychiatric care or helplines. This project is
very important to us, and we hope it can be something that can help others in the future.
